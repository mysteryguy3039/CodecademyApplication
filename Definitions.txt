•	Linked Lists
	- A series of nodes that point to one another like a chain. A singly list will only go in one direction, but a doubly list can go
	forwards and backwards on the chain.

•	Stacks
	- A way of storing nodes using the LIFO (Last In, First Out) concept, such as, a stack of books.

•	Hash Maps
	- A way to have key-value pairs where the key is created by a hash function. The benefit being that it's quicker to access
	the data than a standard index value.

•	Trees
	- A series of child nodes stemming from a root node. Any amount of child nodes can branch off the original root node and then
	more child nodes can branch off the first set of child nodes, making them parent nodes.

•	Heaps
	- A way of prioritizing the nodes in a tree by comparing the child node to the parent node based on their values and whether
	the heap is a max heap (parent is greater than or equal to child) or a min heap (parent is less than or equal to child).
	This style can determine what should be prioritized in a proccessing queue.
